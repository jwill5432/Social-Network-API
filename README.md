# Social Network API

## Description

This project is an api for the backend of a social network website. It stores the user and post information using MongoDb. It contains code for users and their information/posts, and ways to add more and delete on command. This allows the existence of a social media app that can store and maneuver the informtaion in the same way that the database does, creating a complete and secure app. (This was hastily made and did not run in Insomnia).

## Installation

The following must be downloaded before the database can be ran in insomnia.
Insomnia
Node.js
Express
Mongoose
Dotenv
Helmet
Morgan
Nodemon
Once these are all installed, npm start will begin the app and allow it to be accessed in insomnia.

## Usage

Once the app and every file is downloaded, run npm start. This will start the server and sync the mongoose models to the mongo db database. In insomnia, you can then see the formatted routes in a json file. These routes allow you to create, update, and delete posts and users from the database, as well as users reacts to other posts.
